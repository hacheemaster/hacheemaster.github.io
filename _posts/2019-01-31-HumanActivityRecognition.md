# Summary 

1. **Problem Statement**: Use accelerometer data from a smartphone to classify human activites into six classes (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying).
2. **Data**: We will be using the Human Activity Recognition dataset: [UCI HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
3. **Approaches**: 
* LSTM
* CNN-LSTM
* CONV-LSTM

4. **Key Insights**:
* Due to the stochastic nature of neural networks, we need to repeat the experiment multiple times in order to get a stable estimate of a particular architecture's accuracy.
