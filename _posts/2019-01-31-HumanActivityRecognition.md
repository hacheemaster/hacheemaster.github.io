**Problem Statement**: Use accelerometer data from a smartphone to classify human activites into six classes (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying).

**Data**: We will be using the Human Activity Recognition dataset: [UCI HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

**Approaches**:
