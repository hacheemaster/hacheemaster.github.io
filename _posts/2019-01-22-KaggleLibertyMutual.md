**Kaggle Ranking**: Top 12% (248/2,362 competitors)	

**End Date**: August 28, 2015

**Description**: Predict hazard counts for a house given anonymized variables such as roof, foundation, windows, and sliding. The goal is to help Liberty Mutual determine whether they should insure the property. Therefore, aligning Liberty Mutualâ€™s portfolio of home insurance policies with their business goals.

**Best Method**: Weighted Ensemble (RF + XGBoost)

**Reflections**: This [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-group-property-inspection-prediction) was particularly challenging because the anonymized features left little room for feature engineering. It was a fun exercise in ensembling and performing proper cross-validation to prevent overfitting on the public leaderboard, as tempting as that may be.
